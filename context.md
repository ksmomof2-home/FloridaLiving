## 3. ACTIVE TO-DO LIST – November–December 2025
- [x] Fertilize, foil, mulch passionflower, lime, avocado (Nov 20)
- [x] Plant 2 pineapple crowns in Pos 1 (Nov 22)
- [x] Start rosemary cuttings + marigold seeds in small 14" between 1–2 (Nov 22)
- [ ] Plant 2 × Celebrity tomatoes in Pos 2 (arriving soon)
- [ ] Buy remaining 4 bags pine bark nuggets/mini-nuggets

- [ ] Make 8–10 homemade yellow sticky traps
- [ ] Buy/start green bell & jalapeño
- [ ] Buy French marigolds (some seeds started)
- [ ] Make plant signs

## 4. Approved Soil Amendments (ongoing)
- Crushed egg shells → calcium boost, prevents blossom-end rot  
- Used decaf coffee grounds → mild nitrogen + organic matter  
→ Keep adding both every 4–6 weeks (½–1 cup per 30-gal, handful on small pots). Mix lightly into top 1–2 inches or under mulch.

## 5. Herb Propagation Cheat-Sheet
| Herb      | Best method (Nov) | Success rate | Time to roots | Exact steps |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Basil     | Water             | 95–100%      | 7–14 days     | Cut 4–6" tips below node → strip bottom leaves → clear glass of water on windowsill → change water every 2–3 days → pot when roots ½–1" |
| Parsley   | Water             | 90%          | 14–21 days    | Same as basil – use non-flowering stems |
| Rosemary  | Soil (preferred)  | 85–95%       | 3–6 weeks     | Cut 5–7" semi-woody tips → strip bottom 2" → optional rooting hormone → moist potting mix → cover with clear cup/bag first 2 weeks → keep humid |

## 6. Homemade Yellow Sticky Trap Recipe
**Best version for Florida weather**  
Materials: yellow poster board/plates, clear packing tape, Vaseline/Tangle-Trap, stakes  
Steps: cut → tape → smear sticky → hang 6–12" above plants → replace when full.

## 7. French Marigold Placement
2–3 short French marigolds around base of Pos 2, 8, 9, 10, 11.

## 8. Fertilizing Plan
At planting: ½ cup 6-6-6  
Every 4 weeks: fish emulsion 2 Tbsp/gal  
Fruit set: add 0-10-10

## 9. Pest Mitigation – Butterfly & Bee Safe ONLY
- Dusk soap spray for whiteflies  
- Hand-pick or BT for hornworms  
- Yellow sticky traps  
- NEVER neem on host plants

## 10. Whitefly Aluminum Foil + Mulch Instructions
Shiny side up → 4–6 drainage holes → top with pine bark nuggets.

## 11. Pot Turnover Guidelines (Healthy Plants Only)
Whiteflies only → pull main roots, scoop top 4–6", leave fine roots, refresh soil.

## 12. Mulch (permanent)
12 × 30-gal → 3" layer → 5 bags 2 cu ft total (1 used, 4 remaining)

## 13. February 2026 One-Time Task
Remove in-ground bush at real Pos 9 → slide temp pot into spot → plant green bell pepper
