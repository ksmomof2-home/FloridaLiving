## 4. ACTIVE TO-DO LIST – November–December 2025

- [ ] Run/fix drip line to Pos 12 (so rosemary can move from 6 → 12)
- [ ] Empty junk pots 11 & 12
- [ ] Move basil from 7a → big pot 11
- [ ] Move parsley from 5a → big pot 7
- [ ] Move rosemary from 6 → big pot 12 + add Italian oregano
- [ ] Plant 2 × Celebrity tomatoes in Pos 2 (arriving ~Dec 1)
- [ ] Buy/start: bronze fennel, swamp milkweed, jalapeño, green bell, poblano, ginger
- [ ] Buy frost fabric + Christmas lights
- [ ] Make 8–10 homemade yellow sticky traps
- [ ] Make plant signs / QR codes

## 5. Approved Soil Amendments (ongoing)
- Crushed egg shells → calcium boost, prevents blossom-end rot  
- Used decaf coffee grounds → mild nitrogen + organic matter  
→ Keep adding both every 4–6 weeks (½–1 cup per 30-gal, handful on small pots). Mix lightly into top 1–2 inches or under mulch.

## 6. Herb Propagation Cheat-Sheet
| Herb      | Best method (Nov) | Success rate | Time to roots | Exact steps |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Basil     | Water             | 95–100%      | 7–14 days     | Cut 4–6" tips below node → strip bottom leaves → clear glass of water on windowsill → change water every 2–3 days → pot when roots ½–1" |
| Parsley   | Water             | 90%          | 14–21 days    | Same as basil – use non-flowering stems |
| Rosemary  | Soil (preferred)  | 85–95%       | 3–6 weeks     | Cut 5–7" semi-woody tips → strip bottom 2" → optional rooting hormone → moist potting mix → cover with clear cup/bag first 2 weeks → keep humid |

## 7. Homemade Yellow Sticky Trap Recipe
**Best version for Florida weather**  
Materials: yellow poster board/plates, clear packing tape, Vaseline/Tangle-Trap, stakes  
Steps: cut → tape → smear sticky → hang 6–12" above plants → replace when full.

## 8. French Marigold Placement
2–3 short French marigolds around base of Pos 2, 8, 9, 10, 11.

## 9. Fertilizing Plan
At planting: ½ cup 6-6-6  
Every 4 weeks: fish emulsion 2 Tbsp/gal  
Fruit set: add 0-10-10

## 10. Pest Mitigation – Butterfly & Bee Safe ONLY
- Dusk soap spray for whiteflies  
- Hand-pick or BT for hornworms  
- Yellow sticky traps  
- NEVER neem on host plants

## 11. Whitefly Aluminum Foil + Mulch Instructions
Shiny side up → 4–6 drainage holes → top with pine bark nuggets.

## 12. Pot Turnover Guidelines (Healthy Plants Only)
Whiteflies only → pull main roots, scoop top 4–6", leave fine roots, refresh soil.

## 13. Mulch (permanent)
12 × 30-gal → 3" layer → 5 bags 2 cu ft total (1 used, 4 remaining)

## 14. February 2026 One-Time Task
Remove in-ground bush at real Pos 9 → slide temp pot into spot → plant green bell pepper
