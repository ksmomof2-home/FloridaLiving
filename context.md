## 4. Homemade Yellow Sticky Trap Recipe (permanent)
**Best version for Florida weather**  
**Materials** (Dollar Tree / Walmart / Home Depot)  
- Bright yellow poster board or disposable plates  
- Wide clear packing tape or contact paper  
- Vaseline (big jar) or Tangle-Trap paste  
- Bamboo stakes, wire hangers, or golf tees  

**Steps**  
1. Cut yellow card into 6×9 in rectangles (or use yellow plates).  
2. Cover both sides with clear packing tape (rain-proof).  
3. Smear thin layer of Vaseline or Tangle-Trap on both sides.  
4. Poke hole, attach to stake/wire, place 6–12 in above plant canopy.  
5. One trap above each tomato & pepper pot (Pos 2, 8, 9, 10) + extras.  
**Replace** when black with bugs or after heavy rain.

## 5. French Marigold Placement (pest protection)
Plant 2–3 short French marigolds around the base of:
- Pos 2 (tomatoes) – nematode control
- Pos 8 (jalapeño)
- Pos 9 (bell pepper)
- Pos 10 (poblano)
- Pos 11 (basil)

## 6. Fertilizing Plan
| Timing            | Product                         | Rate (30-gal pot)          |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| At planting       | Espoma Tomato-tone or 6-6-6     | ½ cup                      |
| Every 4 weeks     | Fish emulsion or liquid 8-8-8   | 2 Tbsp per gallon water    |
| Fruit set onward  | Add 0-10-10 or banana water     | 1 Tbsp per plant           |
| Herbs             | Half-strength everything        | Light feeders              |

## 7. Pest Mitigation – Butterfly & Bee Safe ONLY
- Whitefly/aphid spray (dusk): 1 gal water + 2 Tbsp Dr. Bronner’s Peppermint Castile + 1 Tbsp hort soap or cold-pressed neem  
- Hornworms → hand-pick or BT only on tomatoes/peppers  
- Yellow sticky traps above every tomato & pepper pot  
- NEVER spray neem on milkweed, parsley, dill, fennel

## 8. Mulch (permanent)
12 × 30-gal pots → 3" layer pine bark nuggets/mini-nuggets → 5 bags (2 cu ft each)

## 9. February 2026 One-Time Task
Remove in-ground bush at real position 9 → slide temporary 30-gal into spot → plant green bell pepper
