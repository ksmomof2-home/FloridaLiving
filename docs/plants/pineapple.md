### Quick Facts
- USDA zones: 9b–11 (marginal in 9b — we protect it!)
- Sun: Full sun (the more the better)
- Water: Average — let top 2–3" dry between waterings
- Mature height in 30-gal pot: 3–4 ft
- Spacing: 2 crowns per 30-gal pot (perfect!)
- Days to fruit from crown: 18–24 months

### Primary Use
- Culinary → sweetest home-grown pineapple you’ll ever taste

### Wildlife Supported
- Nectar for occasional bees & ants
- Not a butterfly host

### Pests to Watch (The Villages)
- Whiteflies → ignore pineapples, no foil needed while rooting
- Mealybugs → rare, wipe with alcohol swab

### Unusual / Fun Facts
- Each plant only fruits once, then dies — but produces pups (baby plants) you can replant forever!
- The crown you twist off a store pineapple is genetically identical to the fruit you just ate.

### Local Care Tips (The Villages 9b)
- Mulch with pine bark (acidic — they love it)
- Add crushed egg shells for calcium
- Bring inside or wrap + Christmas lights below 28 °F
- Current status: 2 crowns rooting in Pos 1 (Nov 22, 2025)
