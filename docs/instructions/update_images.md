1. **Add new photos (if any)**  
   Drop them in `/docs/images/` using the exact naming spell:  
   `pot07_20251129.jpg` (or `_happy.jpg`, `_newleaves.jpg` — extra words are fine).

2. **Refresh the image diary**  
   Double-click your `update-images.ps1` script on your laptop → it instantly rewrites `js/image-list.js` with every photo.

3. **Commit & push** (you’re already doing this directly on GitHub — perfect)  
   Done. Every pot page and the index instantly update — no more editing 20 files ever again.
