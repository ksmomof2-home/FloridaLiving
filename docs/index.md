# Our Villages Garden & Nature Journal

Welcome to our little slice of paradise in Central Florida (USDA 9b)!

We’re slowly turning our backyard fence line into a year-round food + butterfly factory, while the front yard stays mostly native wildflowers and bird-friendly chaos.

### Explore the Gardens
- [Backyard Fence-Line Garden (12 big pots + drip system)](backyard.md) – tomatoes, citrus, swallowtails, monarchs  
- Front yard – coming soon!  
- Native wildflower patches – coming soon!

### Other Living Things We Love
- [Our Pets & Aquariums](docs/pets.md) – dogs, cats, and a very spoiled 75-gallon planted tank  
- Bird feeders & hummingbird station  
- Occasional wildlife visitors (gopher tortoises, sandhill cranes, etc.)
